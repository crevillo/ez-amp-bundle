# eZ AMP Bundle
This is an extension to the eZ Platform CMS that provides Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Support.

Accelerated Mobile Pages is an initiative from Google to speed up mobile browsing. AMP is an open standard based on HTML. It enforces performance by limiting functionality and includes remote caching.

Given Google's continuing dominance search both publishers and CMS vendors need to take AMP into account. This bundle enables <a href="http://ezplatform.com">eZ Platform</a> installations to have quick access to an AMP formatted version of content objects

## Installation

Installation is similar to most Symfony Bundles:

1. Require using composer
2. Update Kernel
3. Add header link to content (to make AMP pages discoverable)
